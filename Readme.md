# Imagery of Past Projects
This repository contains a snapshot of some of my more interesting projects from the 1970's to late 1980's which I can say that I had actually built myself. I do have other interesting hardware projects but some of them were not built by me originally. This will provide you with a bit more visual context as to what type and extent of projects I used to build before getting distracted with a professional career in similar activities. 

I hope to get a good number of these projects properly documented and put up onto my Github site over time.

If you would like to view them in a more interactive manner, on my Flickr site, then please follow these links:
